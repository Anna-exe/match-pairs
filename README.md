## Deployment

### Version Control
-   The site was created using Gitpod editor and pushed to Github to the remote repository 'match-pairs'.
-   Git commands were used throughout the development to push the code to the remote repository. The following git commands were used:
    -   git add . - to add the files to the staging area before being committed.
    -   git commit -m "commit message" - to commit changes to the local repository queue that are ready for the final step.
    -   git push - to push all committed code to the remote repository on Github.

### Forking the GitHub Repository
By forking the repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and change without affecting the original repository by using these steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate [GitHub Repository capital-cities](https://github.com/Anna-exe/match-pairs)
2. At the top of the Repository(under the main navigation) locate "Fork" button.
3. Now you should have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Local Clone
-   Go to the Github repository that you want to clone
-   Click on the Code button located above all the project files
-   Click on HTTPS and copy the repository link
-   Open the IDE of your choice and and paste the copied git url into the IDE terminal
-   The project is now created as a local clone
