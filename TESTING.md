## **During Development Testing**
During the development process, I was manually testing in the following ways:-

1. Manually testing each element for appearance and responsiveness,I used Chrome developer tools extensively during development to troubleshoot issues.
    
2. Published the page via GitHub pages and shared with my friends.

### **Manual Testing:**
* During testing, I used four different browsers to ensure cross-compatibility. The desktop browsers used by myself were:

  1. Chrome
  2. Firefox  
  3. Opera
  4. Edge

* I then used the devtools to simulate different screen sizes from 280px up to 1920px in width. 
* In addition to this, I also tested it on my smartphone.

### **Bugs and Fixes:**

* No bugs found during development

### **Lighthouse Scores**
* I did all lighthouse tests in incognito mode to avoid interference from browser extensions. 
* I ran the tests for both mobile and desktop. 
- No errors found
- Got performance scores of 60-69 with the main issue being **Largest Contentful Paint element 13,430 ms**

  - Asked help on slack
  
  - Resolved desktop score by changing card image sources to local files with smaller sizes

  - But score on mobile devices is only 70, unfortunately don't have time to look into that

### **Unfixed bugs**

- When doing a hard refresh, the user can see the face of cards for a short moment, it could be resolved by following the performance issue advice from lighthouse.
- To resolve performance issues I could display all card images in an HTML page, but this project was specifically JavaScript, so with the advice of my mentor and slack community, I displayed images with help of JS array.
